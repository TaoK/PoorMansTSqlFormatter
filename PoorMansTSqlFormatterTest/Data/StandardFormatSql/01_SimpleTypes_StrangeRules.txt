--I have to include this just because of the fun insight into

-- "Incorrect syntax near '0x0a'." - so the tokenizer

-- structure of the SQL, and doesn't appear to know that the 
-- value has changed! (or it would be too much of a pain to 
-- keep the original value around just for the error message...?)
