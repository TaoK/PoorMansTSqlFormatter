             * System.Web just for HtmlEncode was always a little disturbing anyway.
             * I've attempted to optimize the implementation towards strings that don't actually contain any special

             * (pointers, and some special handling in the WinAnsi special range of characters?), keeping it to the basic 
             * 4 "known bad" characters.
