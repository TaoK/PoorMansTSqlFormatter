## Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter

This is a small free .Net 2.0 library (with demo winforms program, web service, SSMS 
and Visual Studio Addin, Command-line utility, Notepad++ plugin, and WinMerge plugin) 
for reformatting T-SQL code.


### Features

* Simple Xml-based parse tree
* Extensible, with possibility of supporting other SQL dialects (but none implemented)
* Configurable according to SQL formatting preferences
* Handles "procedural" T-SQL; this is not just a SQL statement formatter, but it also 
    formats entire batches, and multi-batch scripts.
* Optional colorized HTML output
* Fault-tolerant parsing and formatting - if some unknown SQL construct is encountered
    or a keyword is misinterpreted, parsing does not fail (but will simply not colorize
    or indent that portion correctly). If the parsing fails more catastrophically, a 
    "best effort" will be made and warning displayed (or in the case of interactive 
    use, eg in SSMS, the operation can be aborted).
* Reasonably fast: reformatting 1,500 or so files totalling 4MB takes 30 seconds on a 
    cheap atom-processor (2009) netbook.
* Works in Microsoft .Net framework, as well as Mono. The Winforms Demo App is not (yet?)
    available in Mono, but the library itself is fully functional, as is the command-line
    bulk formatting tool.


### General Limitations

* This is NOT a full SQL-parsing solution: only "coarse" parsing is performed, the 
    minimum necessary for re-formatting.
* The standard formatter does not always maintain the order of comments in the code;
    a comment inside an "INNER JOIN" compound keyword, like "inner/\*test\*/join", would
    get moved out, to "INNER JOIN /\*test\*/". The original data is maintaned in the 
    parse tree, but the standard formatter shuffles comments in cases like this for 
    clarity.
* DDL parsing, in particular, is VERY coarse - the bare minimum to display ordered table 
    column and procedure parameter declarations.
* No effort has been made to support compatibility level 70 (SQL Server 7)
* Where there is ambiguity between different compatibility levels (eg cross apply 
    parens in compatibility level 90 vs table hints without "WITH" keyword in 
    compatibility level 80), no approach has been decided. For now, table hints 
    without WITH are considered to be arguments to a function.
* Settings may not be correctly maintained across major upgrades of SSMS and Visual Studio
 
### Known Issues / Todo

* Handling of DDL Triggers (eg "FOR LOGON")
* Formatting/indenting of ranking functions 
* FxCop checking
* And other stuff that is tracked in the GitHub issues list


### Longer-term enhancements / additions

* Compiled mono library + bulk formatting tool download (eg for use on SVN server)
* Documentation of Xml structure and class usage
    * Keeping track of versioning and documentation more carefully: http://semver.org/
