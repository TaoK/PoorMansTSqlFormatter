DESCRIPTION

ReportGenerator converts XML reports generated by OpenCover, PartCover, dotCover, Visual Studio, NCover or Cobertura
into human readable reports in various formats.

The reports do not only show the coverage quota, but also include the source code and visualize which lines have been
covered.

ReportGenerator supports merging several reports into one.
It is also possible to pass one XML file containing several reports to ReportGenerator (e.g. a build log file).

The following output formats are supported by ReportGenerator:

-HTML, HTMLSummary, HTMLInline, HTMLChart, MHTML
-XML, XMLSummary
-Latex, LatexSummary
-TextSummary
-CsvSummary
-PngChart
-Badges
-Custom formats (https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator/wiki/Custom-reports)

Compatibility:

OpenCover
PartCover 4.0
PartCover 2.2, 2.3
dotCover
Visual Studio (vstest.console.exe, CodeCoverage.exe)
NCover (tested version 1.5.8, other versions may not work)
