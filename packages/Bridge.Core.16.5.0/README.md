[Bridge.NET](http://bridge.net/) is an open source C#-to-JavaScript Compiler. Write your application in C# and run on billions of devices.

Compile your C#...

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var msg = "Hello, World!";
        
        Console.WriteLine(msg);
    }
}
```

into JavaScript

```js
Bridge.define("Demo.Program", {
    main: function Main () {
        var msg = "Hello, World!";

        System.Console.WriteLine(msg);
    }
});
```

Run the sample above at [Deck.NET](https://deck.net/helloworld).

## Getting Started

A great place to start if you're new to Bridge is reviewing the [Getting Started](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Bridge/wiki) wiki.

The easiest place to see Bridge in action is [Deck.NET](https://deck.net/). 

[![Video Tutorial](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62210/30412015-ee0e9ccc-98d1-11e7-9a28-3bc02b900190.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEUR1UthE2c)

## Sample

The following code sample demonstrates a simple **App.cs** class that will run automatically on page load and write a message to the Bridge Console.

**Example ([Deck](https://deck.net/7fb39e336182bea04c695ab43379cd8c))**

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

The C# class above will be compiled into JavaScript and added to **/Bridge/ouput/demo.js** within your project. By default, Bridge will use the Namespace name as the file name. In this case: **demo.js**. There are many options to control the output of your JavaScript files, and the [Attribute Reference](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Bridge/wiki/attribute-reference) is important [documentation](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Bridge/wiki) to review.

```javascript
Bridge.define("Demo.Program", {
    main: function Main() {
        System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
});
```

## Installation

A full list of installation options available at [bridge.net/download/](http://bridge.net/download/), including full support for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Community on Windows, and Visual Studio Mac.

### Bridge for Visual Studio

If you're using Visual Studio for Windows, the easiest way to get started is by adding the Bridge.NET for Visual Studio [extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dca5c80f-a0df-4944-8343-9c905db84757).

From within Visual Studio, go to the `Tools > Extensions and Updates...`.

![Bridge for Visual Studio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62210/29292228-932ebb7e-8103-11e7-952a-3088274acf10.png)

From the options on the left side, be sure to select **Online**, then search for **Bridge**. Clicking **Download** will install Bridge for Visual Studio. After installation is complete, Visual Studio may require a restart.

Once installation is complete you will have a new **Bridge.NET** project type. When creating new Bridge enabled projects, select this project type. 
### NuGet

Another option is installation of Bridge into a new **C# Class Library** project using [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/bridge). Within the NuGet Package Manager, search for **Bridge** and click to install. 

Bridge can also be installed using the NuGet Command Line tool by running the following command:

```
Install-Package Bridge
```

More information regarding Nuget package installation for Bridge is available in the [Documentation](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Bridge/wiki/nuget-installation).
